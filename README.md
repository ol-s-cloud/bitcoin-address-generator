Introduction
------------

This repository explores the use of randomly generated hexadecimal numbers to create a bitcoin wallet address using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.
Supposing Alice wants to buy a book from Bob. After all has been agreed and done, Bob needs to provide Alice witha bitcoin wallet address where the payments will be deposited to. The transaction will be done on the blockchain so Bob needs a bitcoin wallet wallet address to receive payments. This repository covers how a bitcoin wallet address can be created from randomly generated private keys. 

In cryptography, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) offers a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic-curve cryptography.

## Method


Diagram below illustrates the architecture and how the Bitcoin wallet addresses are created.
