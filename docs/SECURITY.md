# Security Considerations

## Important Notice

This package is primarily for **educational purposes**. While it implements standard cryptographic operations for Bitcoin address generation, please consider the following security implications before using it in any production environment.

## Key Security Considerations

### 1. Private Key Generation
- The randomness of private keys is crucial for security
- Consider using hardware security modules (HSM) for production use
- Never reuse private keys across different wallets
- Keep private keys secret and securely stored

### 2. Environmental Security
- Run in a secure, isolated environment
- Avoid generating keys on shared or public computers
- Use offline key generation for high-value wallets
- Clear memory after key operations

### 3. Network Security
- Never transmit private keys over networks
- Use secure channels for public key distribution
- Validate all inputs thoroughly
- Be aware of potential man-in-the-middle attacks

### 4. Storage Security
- Never store private keys in plain text
- Use proper encryption for key storage
- Consider cold storage solutions for significant amounts
- Implement proper backup procedures

## Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all input parameters
   - Check key formats and lengths
   - Verify address checksums

2. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Handle exceptions securely

3. **Key Management**
   - Implement key rotation policies
   - Use strong passwords for key encryption
   - Consider multi-signature solutions

4. **Testing**
   - Regular security audits
   - Penetration testing
   - Code review for security issues

## Known Limitations

1. This package:
   - Does not implement HD wallet features
   - Does not provide secure key storage
   - Does not handle transaction signing
   - Is not audited for production use

2. The random number generation:
   - Uses Python's cryptographic functions
   - May not be suitable for high-security requirements
   - Should be enhanced for production use

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security issues, please report them to gs_wl889@icloud.com.

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
